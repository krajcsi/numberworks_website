## Open PhD positions

Our lab is accepting applications for PhD positions in both numerical cognition and statistics/methodology for working on the analysis software CogStat. To find more information about the topics check the lab's website:

* Several of our former numerical cognition works are available on our lab's website's [Numerical cognition pages](https://www.thenumberworks.org/numerical_cognition.html). We are still actively working on several of those topics.

* Our lab also works on the automatic analysis software, [CogStat](https://www.cogstat.org/). Find some of the possibilities you can contribute to this project in the [Contributor documentation](https://github.com/cogstat/cogstat/wiki/Documentation-for-contributors).

The decision about the potential supervision is based on a mini-project closely related to the planned PhD topic. The candidate and the lab members form a brief plan for the mini project with a clearly defined output, and the candidate can work on that project with the lead of the supervisor. After completing the mini-project, the candidate and the lab leader decides whether the collaborative work is expected to be fruitful.

For an initial application contact [Attila Krajcsi](mailto:krajcsi@gmail.com) with your CV, a brief motivation letter and an initial, half page long PhD research plan.

Doctoral students will participate in the [Cognitive Psychology Programme](https://www.ppk.elte.hu/en/psychologyphd/doctoraltraining) of ELTE Eötvös Loránd University. One possible source of financing is the [Stipendium Hungaricum Scholarship](https://www.elte.hu/en/stipendium_hungaricum?m=59)
