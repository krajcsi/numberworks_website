We provide some spreadsheet solutions to calculate the extremity of a single-case performance with a relatively small control group, and the dissociation (or double dissociation) of two tasks of a single case compared to the control group. The [methods](http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/j.crawford/pages/dept/SingleCaseMethodology.htm) were originally proposed by John R. Crawford.
